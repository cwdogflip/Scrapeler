# Scrapeler
Scrapeler is a webscraper for harvesting images from gelbooru (and eventually other booru style sites.)


Scrapeler requires the following libraries:
* beautifulsoup4
* pillow
* requests
* fake-useragent
* html5lib

The easiest way to install these is to navigate to your Scrapeler directory, and run the command "pip install -r scrapeler_requirements.txt"
